# Limit-plus
A video streaming site

This project was for my uni degree but was only meant to be a static website which I felt was not modern and just didn't uphold to modern day websites so I made it responsive whilst still upholding the brief the teacher gave. My teacher was pretty impressed that I learned how to do responsive websites by myself as he is more of a designer than a builder.

As it was for uni the website has a linear site-map and is as follows -------

login -----> far-left profile ------> captain marvel

This is the website I am most proud of as I feel it encapsulates great design and great functionality. IT IS NOT FINISHED hand in date for this project is the end of May so there is a few features I still want to add one being local storage and saving things to a my list section which I think would be awesome.

A stand out feature was using an API to search through movies which really opened my eyes to what cool things API's can do and since then I have played around with so many and love learning about them. In this particuler instance the API is from TMDB and I used a tiny bit of OOP for the first time, I used object destructuring and this allowed me to get data from within an object and use a template literal to display it. As well as that I used if/else statements which helped with the traffic light review system which also derived from the destructuring of teh API

I also tried a javascript library called JS.swiper in this project it allowed me to create a simple carousel which looked really good however makig it responsive was a pain, I did however make a slider on the captain marvel page and came under a bit of a problem which was scoping, I struggled for days! But then i re-jigged the code and found out it was teh placement of the functions and this then lead me to explore what scoping and closures meant which was super useful.

As well as this the login page is very heavy on the css animation side of things which was to be honest really fun to play around with and create little gimmicky animations. There is definitely scope to having cool animations as when I look online at some peoples animations I am in awe.
